# Dungeon Crawler
Team: Anna Rahn, Jason Mu, Sam Carruthers

The player wakes up in a dimly lit cave with no memory of how they got there. All they possess is a rusty sword. There are several tunnels coming out from the room, so they start to explore. They can navigate using a GUI menu. We will randomly generate a room, either hostile or safe, every time they travel through a tunnel and add it to the map. In hostile rooms, players will encounter different monsters (randomly chosen) and either fight or run away from them. The fights will be turn-based where the player gets to decide whether they fight, use an item, or run away. After their selection, the monster will go and attack the player. These turns continue to alternate until the monster is defeated or the player runs away. The room is cleared after the player defeats the monster and then changes from a hostile room to a safe room. If the player runs away successfully, they will go into a new room via a random tunnel. In safe rooms, the player will reach chests that contain randomly generated items that can help them on their way. These items can be buffs or equipment that can help the player to become more powerful. To escape and win the game, the player must defeat four hostile rooms and a final boss room.
